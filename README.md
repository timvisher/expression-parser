# expression-parser

Install [leiningen][] to start this puppy up!

`cd` into the root of the project and run `lein test` to see the magic happen.

A test for the expression we were working on is in [test/expression_parser/core_test.clj](https://github.com/timvisher/expression-parser/blob/master/test/expression_parser/core_test.clj) and the source is located at [src/expression_parser/core.clj](https://github.com/timvisher/expression-parser/blob/master/src/expression_parser/core.clj).

Enjoy!
